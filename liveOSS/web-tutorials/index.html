<h2> Welcome To OpenSpeedShop Live </h2>
Welcome to OpenSpeedShop Live, a live Linux distribution with a
pre-configured OpenSpeedShop installation. Test applications are
provided, smg2000 (sequential/MPI) and forever, and are located in
/home/openssuser/sequential/smg2000/test,
/home/openssuser/mpi/smg2000/test, and /home/openssuser/sequential,
respectively.

<h2> Brief Open|SpeedShop Overview </h2>
Open|SpeedShop is an open source, multi-platform Linux performance tool
which is targeted to support performance analysis of applications
running on both single node and large scale systems with Intel&reg;'s
Itanium2&reg;'s, Intel Pentium&reg;'s, Pentium&reg;'s II Xeon<small><sup>TM</sup></small>
and AMD Opteron<small><sup>TM</sup></small> processors. <br>
<br>
Open|SpeedShop is co-funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). It was originally
developed by Silicon Graphics in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National
Laboratory. Open|SpeedShop utilizes both dynamic instrumentation
technology developed at the University of Wisconson and University of
Maryland and link-time instrumentation technology.<br>
<br>
Open|SpeedShop development is now done by the Krell Institute and DOE's
tri-labs. The infrastructure and base components of Open|SpeedShop are
released as open source code under GPL and LGPL. <br>

<b>Note:</b> We are in the process of updating our documentation. In
particular, we are adding information about our new offline
instrumentor and updated framework.
<h2> About Getting Started </h2>
The primary focus of this document will be on introducing many of
Open|SpeedShop's key features. In particular we will be covering: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Common Terminology</li>
  <li>Available Experiments</li>
  <li>Open|SpeedShop Invocation</li>
  <li>Using Open|SpeedShop's Interactive Command Line Interface (CLI)</li>
  <li>Using Open|SpeedShop's Graphical User Interface (GUI)</li>
  <li>Getting More Information</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Common Terminology</h2>
Technical terms can have multiple and/or context sensitive meanings,
therefore this section attempts to explain and clarify the meanings of
the terms used in this document.
<ul>
  <li><b>Experiment:</b> A set of collectors and executables bound
together to generate performance metrics.</li>
  <li><b>Focused Experiment:</b> The current experiment commands
operate on. The user may run or view multiple experiments
simultaneously and unless a particular experiment is specified
directly, the focused experiment will used. Experiments are given an
enumeration (expId) for identification.</li>
  <li><b>Component(s):</b> A somewhat self-contained section of the
Open|SpeedShop performance tool. This section of code does a set of
specific related tasks for the tool. For example, the GUI component
does all the tasks related to displaying Open|SpeedShop wizards,
experiment creation, and results using a graphical user interface. The
CLI component does similar functions but uses the interactive command
line delivery method.</li>
  <li><b>Collector:</b> The portion of the tool containing logic that
is responsible for the gathering of the performance metric. A collector
is a portion of the code that is included in the experiment plugin.</li>
  <li><b>Metric:</b> The entity, which the collector/experiment is
gathering. A time, occurrence counter, or other entity, which reflects
in some way on the applications performance and is gathered by a
performance experiment (by the collector).</li>
  <li><b>Param:</b> Each collector allows the user to set certain
values that control the way a collector behaves. The parameter or param
may cause the collector to perform various operations at certain time
intervals or it may cause a collector to measure certain types of data.
Although Open|SpeedShop provides a standard way to set a parameter, it
is up to the individual collector to decide what to do with that
information. Detailed documentation about the available parameters is
part of the collector's documentation.</li>
  <li><b>Framework:</b> The set of API functions that allows the user
interface to manage the creation and viewing of performance
experiments. It is the interface between the user interface and the
cluster support and dynamic instrumentation components.</li>
  <li><b>Plugin:</b> A portion of the performance tool that can be
loaded and included in the tool at tool start-up time. Development of
the plugin uses a tool specific interface (API) so that the plugin, and
the tool it is to be included in, know how to interact with each other.
Plugins are normally placed in a specific directory so that the tool
knows where to find the plugins.</li>
  <li><b>Target:</b> This is the application or part of the application
one is running the experiment on. In order to fine tune what is being
targeted, Open|SpeedShop gives target options that describes file
names, host names, thread identifiers, rank identifiers and process
identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Available Experiments</h2>
<p><a href="details/experiment-details.html">Table: Summary of
Experiments</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>fpe:</b> Collects all floating-point exceptions with the call
stack and the time of exception. </li>
  <li><b>hwc:</b> Counts at the source line, machine instruction, and
function levels of various hardware events. </li>
  <li><b>hwctime:</b> Similar to <b>hwc</b>, except that callstack
sampling is used. </li>
  <li><b>io:</b> Times I/O system calls. The time reported is wall
clock time. </li>
  <li><b>iot:</b> Traces and times I/O system calls. The time reported
is wall clock time. </li>
  <li><b>mpi:</b> Times calls to various MPI routines. The time
reported is wall clock time. </li>
  <li><b>mpiotf:</b> Traces ant time to various MPI routines - OTF
format. The time reported is wall clock time. </li>
  <li><b>mpit:</b> Traces and times calls to various MPI routines. The
time reported is wall clock time. </li>
  <li><b>pcsamp:</b> Actual CPU time at the source line, machine
instruction, and function level. </li>
  <li><b>usertime:</b> Inclusive and exclusive CPU time for each
function. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Open|SpeedShop Invocation</h2>
<a href="details/invocation-details.html">Open|SpeedShop Invocation

<ul>
  <li><b>openss [-gui]:</b> Start Open|SpeedShop's graphical interface.
  </li>
  <li><b>openss -cli:</b> Start Open|SpeedShop's interactive command
line interface. </li>
  <li><b>openss -offline:</b> Start an offline (link in collectors)

  <li><b>openss -batch:</b> Start a performance experiment. specified
by additional arguments, directly without user interaction </li>
</ul>
