    <h2> Brief Open|SpeedShop Overview </h2>
    Open|SpeedShop is an open source, multi-platform Linux performance
    tool
    which is targeted to support performance analysis of applications
    running on both single node and large scale systems with
    Intel&reg;'s
    Itanium2&reg;'s, Intel Pentium&reg;'s, Pentium&reg;'s II Xeon<small><sup>TM</sup></small>,
    AMD Opteron<small><sup>TM</sup></small>, and IBM PPC, processors, as
    well as Blue Gene and Cray XT/XE systems.<br>
    <br>
    Open|SpeedShop is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
    National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). It was originally
    developed by Silicon Graphics in collaboration with Lawrence
    Livermore
    National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia
    National
    Laboratory.&nbsp; Open|SpeedShop utilizes both dynamic
    instrumentation
    technology developed at the University of Wisconson and University
    of
    Maryland and link-time instrumentation technology.<br>
    <br>
    Open|SpeedShop development is now done by the Krell Institute, DOE's
    Tri-labs, and support from the Office of Science.&nbsp; The
    infrastructure and base components of Open|SpeedShop are
    released as open source code primarily under the LGPL license.<br>
    <br>

    <h2> About Getting Started </h2>
    The primary focus of this document will be on introducing many of
    Open|SpeedShop's key features. In particular we will be covering: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Common Terminology</li>
      <li>Available Experiments</li>
      <li>Open|SpeedShop Invocation</li>
      <li>Using Open|SpeedShop's Interactive Command Line Interface
        (CLI)</li>
      <li>Using Open|SpeedShop's Graphical User Interface (GUI)</li>
      <li>Getting More Information</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Common Terminology</h2>
    Technical terms can have multiple and/or context sensitive meanings,
    therefore this section attempts to explain and clarify the meanings
    of
    the terms used in this document.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Experiment:</b> A set of collectors and executables bound
        together to generate performance metrics.</li>
      <li><b>Focused Experiment:</b> The current experiment commands
        operate on. The user may run or view multiple experiments
        simultaneously and unless a particular experiment is specified
        directly, the focused experiment will used. Experiments are
        given an
        enumeration (expId) for identification.</li>
      <li><b>Component(s):</b> A somewhat self-contained section of the
        Open|SpeedShop performance tool. This section of code does a set
        of
        specific related tasks for the tool. For example, the GUI
        component
        does all the tasks related to displaying Open|SpeedShop wizards,
        experiment creation, and results using a graphical user
        interface. The
        CLI component does similar functions but uses the interactive
        command
        line delivery method.</li>
      <li><b>Collector:</b> The portion of the tool containing logic
        that
        is responsible for the gathering of the performance metric. A
        collector
        is a portion of the code that is included in the experiment
        plugin.</li>
      <li><b>Metric:</b> The entity, which the collector/experiment is
        gathering. A time, occurrence counter, or other entity, which
        reflects
        in some way on the applications performance and is gathered by a
        performance experiment (by the collector).</li>
      <li><b>Param:</b> Each collector allows the user to set certain
        values that control the way a collector behaves. The parameter
        or param
        may cause the collector to perform various operations at certain
        time
        intervals or it may cause a collector to measure certain types
        of data.
        Although Open|SpeedShop provides a standard way to set a
        parameter, it
        is up to the individual collector to decide what to do with that
        information. Detailed documentation about the available
        parameters is
        part of the collector's documentation.</li>
      <li><b>Framework:</b> The set of API functions that allows the
        user
        interface to manage the creation and viewing of performance
        experiments. It is the interface between the user interface and
        the
        cluster support and dynamic instrumentation components.</li>
      <li><b>Plugin:</b> A portion of the performance tool that can be
        loaded and included in the tool at tool start-up time.
        Development of
        the plugin uses a tool specific interface (API) so that the
        plugin, and
        the tool it is to be included in, know how to interact with each
        other.
        Plugins are normally placed in a specific directory so that the
        tool
        knows where to find the plugins.</li>
      <li><b>Target:</b> This is the application or part of the
        application
        one is running the experiment on. In order to fine tune what is
        being
        targeted, Open|SpeedShop gives target options that describes
        file
        names, host names, thread identifiers, rank identifiers and
        process
        identifiers.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
