.SH NAME
osspcsamp \- Open|SpeedShop Program counter experiment script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.IP "osspcsamp simple_executable" 
.IP "osspcsamp ""executable args""  "
.IP "osspcsamp ""multi_executable"" "
.fi


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B osspcsamp

osspcsamp is a convenience command script that invokes the 
Open|SpeedShop application level performance tool to gather 
program counter sampling performance information about
the application being monitored and reports that information back to the
user in order to locate performance bottlenecks in user applications.

osspcamp does periodic sampling of the program counter giving 
a low overhead overview of where the time is being spent in 
the user application.

Information that is presented after the execution of the pcsamp
experiment is exclusive CPU time for all the functions in the program, 
which statement took the most time in the application, performance data 
information presented sorted by linked object, functions, or statement.


.SH OPTIONS

.IP "simple_executable"
This option specifies the simple executable to be run. By 
simple executable we mean a one word command with no arguments.
No quotes around the executable name are needed when the command
is a single word command with no arguments.

.IP " ""executable args"" "
This option specifies an executable with arguments to be run. In
this case the executable can be a one word command or a multiword
command, such as a mpi command specification. For example:

        "simple_executable -n 40 40 40"

or

        "/opt/mpi/mpirun -np 64 ./executable_name" 

Open|SpeedShop requires quotes around the executable and arguments when 
the executable command is not simple.

.IP " ""multi_executable [args]"" "
This option specifies a multi word executable with or without
arguments to be run. In this case the executable is multi word 
command or a multiword command, such as a mpi command 
specification. For example: 

        "/opt/mpi/mpirun -np 64 ./executable_name" 

Open|SpeedShop requires quotes around the executable and arguments when 
the executable command is not simple.

.SH FILES
.IP ~/.qt/openspeedshoprc
.RS
The Open|SpeedShop preference configuration file which is 
accessed through the Open|SpeedShop GUI Preferences menu item.
This file contains several options which allow the user to 
configure Open|SpeedShop to better fit their needs.

See the Open|SpeedShop Users Guide for full details on the
preferences available.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP OPENSS_RAWDATA_DIR
On a cluster where /tmp is not shared across nodes, this
environment variable needs to be set to a path to a shared
file system that is accessible from all the nodes of the
cluster.  The offline mode of operation for Open|SpeedShop
needs a shared file system location to write the files containing
the performance information from each process on all the
nodes of the cluster involved in the experiment.
.IP OPENSS_PCSAMP_RATE
This environment variable allows control over how often the
application is interrupted to take a sample of the program
counter.  When interrupted the program counter address is recorded
and saved.  This information is used to form a report indicating where
the program is spending most of its time.  The default sampling rate
is 100 times per second.  If this number is changed to be higher, more
samples will be taken and, of course, lower the sampling rate reduces
the number of samples taken.  The effect of raising the sampling rate
is more pertibation of the application, but also, perhaps, a more 
accurate statistical sample of where the program is spending its time.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The following diagnostics may be TBD:

.SH QUICK START EXAMPLE
The following command runs the MPI executable "mpi_prog" and gathers 
program counter sampling information on the 64 ranked processes.  
When completed, a view of the aggregated information is displayed 
to the screen.  An Open|SpeedShop database file, named 
"mpi_prog-openmpi-pcsamp.openss" will be created.  This database 
contains all the information to view the experiment performance data
postmortem.  The database file may be used to view the performance 
data for this experiment with the default view or using the several 
different viewing options which allow rank to rank comparisons or 
the ability to view performance information for individual ranks 
or groups of ranks.

The "pcsamp" experiment type gives a good, low overhead, overview 
of where application bottlenecks are.  The output from this experiment 
can then be used to choose another of the Open|SpeedShop experiments 
to further focus in on the application bottleneck(s).
