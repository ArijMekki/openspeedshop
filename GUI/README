From the .../GUI directory type:
$ ./mc
This will configure and build the GUI portion of OpenSpeedShop.
When the build completes you should be able to run.  The script to 
launch the tool is ft.  (Also located in the .../GUI directory.)
$ ft
If ft fails to execute, check to make sure the FUTURE_TOOL_PLUGIN_DIR
is set to the install location.   
You may also need to modify ft if your WORKAREA isn't pointing to the 
directory just above GUI.   There are currently 3 locations that must
be modified.    I'm hoping to fix those next.
