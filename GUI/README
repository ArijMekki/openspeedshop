p_tupdate this tree....

From the .../GUI directory type:
$ ./mc
This will configure and build the GUI portion of OpenSpeedShop.
When the build completes you should be able to run.  The script to 
launch the tool is ft.  (Also located in the .../GUI directory.)
$ ft
If ft fails to execute, check to make sure the FUTURE_TOOL_PLUGIN_DIR
is set to the install location.  The default setting for FUTURE_TOOL_PLUGIN_DIR
is usually: .../GUI/plugin/lib/futuretool

On hope.americas.sgi.com, mine is set to:
$ set | grep FUTU
FUTURE_TOOL_PLUGIN_DIR=/home/tulip22/stipek/OpenSpeedShop/current/GUI/plugin/lib/futuretool

$ ft --help 
Gives a simple usage command.


To make the doxygen documentation: (again from the .../GUI directory)
# mkdoc
