//! UserTimePanel Class
/*! UserTimePanel Class is intended to be used as a starting point to create
    user defined panels.   There's a script: mknewpanel that takes this
    template panel and creates a panel for the user to work with.    (See:
    mknewpanel in this directory.  i.e. type: mknewpanel --help)

    $ mknewpanel
    usage: mknewpanel directory panelname "menu header" "menu label" "show immediate" "grouping"
    where:
      directory:  Is the path to the directory to put the new panel code.
      panelname:  Is the name of the new panel.
      menu header: Is the Menu named to be put on the menu bar.
      menu label: Is the menu label under the menu header.
      show immediate: Default is 0.  Setting this to 1 will display the panel upon initialization.
      grouping: Which named panel container should this menu item drop this panel by default.


    An exmple would be to cd to this UserTimePanel directory and issue the
    following command:
    mknewpanel ../NewPanelName "NewPanelName" "New Panel Menu Heading" "New Panel Label" 0 "Performance"

    That command would create a new panel directory, with the necessary
    structure for the user to create a new panel.   The user's new panel would
    be in the NewPanelName directory.   The future panel would be called,
    "NewPanelName".   A toplevel menu heading will be created called "New 
    Panel Menu Heading".   An entry under that topleve menu would read "New
    Panel Label".    The panel would not be displayed upon initialization of
    the tool, but only upon menu selection.    The final argument hints to the 
    tool that this panel belongs to the group of other Performance related 
    panels.
