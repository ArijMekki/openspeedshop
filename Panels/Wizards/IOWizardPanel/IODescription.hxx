#define vIODescription "The I/O trace experiment shows you the level of I/O activity in your program by tracing various I/O system calls, for example read(2) and write(2).\n\n\nThe prof output of an I/O trace experiment yields the following information:\n\n*  The number of I/O system calls executed.\n\n* The number of calls with an incomplete traceback.\n\n* The [index] column assigns a reference number to each function.\n\n* The number of I/O-related system calls from each function in the program.\n\n* The percentage of I/O-related system calls from each function in the program.\n\n* The percentage of I/O-related system calls encountered so far in the list of functions.\n\n* The number of I/O-related system calls made by a given function and by all the functions ultimately called by that given function. For example, the main function will probably include all of the program's I/O calls with complete tracebacks.\n\n* The percentage of I/O-related system calls made by a given function and by all the functions ultimately called by that given function.\n\n* The DSO, file name, and line number for each function."
