#define vHW_CounterDescription  "In the Open/Speedshop hardware counter experiments, overflows of a particular hardware counter are recorded. Each hardware counter is configured to count from zero to a number designated as the overflow value. When the counter reaches the overflow value, the system resets it to zero and increments the number of overflows at the present program instruction address. Each experiment provides two possible overflow values; the values are prime numbers, so any profiles that seem the same for both overflow values should be statistically valid.\n\nThe experiments described in this section are available for systems that have hardware counters class machines).  Hardware counters allow you to count various types of events, such as cache misses and counts of issued and graduated instructions.\n\nA hardware counter works as follows: for each event, the appropriate hardware counter is incremented on the processor clock cycle. For example, when a floating-point instruction is graduated in a cycle, the graduated floating-point instruction counter is incremented by 1.\n\nThese experiments are detailed by nature. They return information gathered at the hardware level. You probably want to run a higher level experiment first.  Once you have narrowed the scope, you can use hardware counter experiments to pinpoint the area to be tuned."
