#define vpcSampleDescripition "The pc Sample experiment estimates the actual CPU time for each source code line, machine code line, and function in your program. The report listing of this experiment shows exclusive pc Sample time. This experiment is a lightweight, high-speed operation that makes use of the operating system.\n\nCPU time is calculated by multiplying the number of times an instruction or function appears in the PC by the interval specified for the experiment (either 1 or 10 milliseconds).\n\nTo collect the data, the operating system regularly stops the process, increments a counter corresponding to the current value of the PC, and resumes the process. The default sample interval is 10 millisecond.\n\npc Sample runs should slow the execution time of the program down no more than 5 percent. The measurements are statistical in nature, meaning they exhibit variance inversely proportional to the running time."
