1) Add a scrollview bar to the preference panel General page

2) Add toolbar and icons to the Customize Stats Panel for more eas of use.

3) Add an option to enable and disable the showing of the advanced (more robust) feature icons in the StatsPanel toolbar.

4) Use the above option to reduce the toolbar to a manageable number for normal users.

5) Add a feature to allow users to get at the various metrics (specific pieces of performance information) for each experiment by selecting checkboxes corresponding to the metrics.  The StatsPanel icon "OV" representing Optional View, will raise a dialog panel corresponding to the particular experiment.   Check the boxes and when "OK" is clicked a new StatsPanel view reflecting the choices will be generated.

6) Add the "TS" icon in the StatsPanel to bring up the Time Segment dialog box.  This lets the user choose the part his programs execution to view the data for.  So, by choosing a segment of the programs execution, only that portion of the programs performance data will be shown when the user clicks the "OK" button.

7) Improvements to the MPICH2 and MVAPICH configuration.  Add support for configuration of MVAPICH2.

8) TBD

9) TBD
