USE THIS WHEN YOU HAVE ROOT ACCESS AND CAN INSTALL RPMS.  
or would like to install as none root using cpio

This directory setup will hopefully make it
easier to build and install OpenSpeedShop once support tools
have been built.

The script, Build-RPM, will create the component RPM
in the RPMS directory.   Build-RPM takes the spec
file name of the component as input.  The spec
files are in the SPECS directory.  Here is the
key OpenSpeedShop spec file that will be found in the
SPECS directory for the current version of OpenSpeedShop:

openspeedshop-1.00.spec

First setup the loaction where you want you default install to be

   Set envronment variables
   setenv OPENSSROOT_PREFIX /<path for install>
   setenv OPENSSROOT_DEPEND /<path for initial support product install>
   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/<path for initial support product install>/<lib>
    or
   export OPENSSROOT_PREFIX=/<path for install>
   export OPENSSROOT_DEPEND=/<path for initial support product install>
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/<path for initial support product install>/<lib>



Build OpenSpeedShop and install it 

   From the OpenSpeedShop_ROOT directory do:
   ./Build-RPM openspeedshop-1.00

   If you have root:
   cd RPMS/<platform>
   su
   rpm --install openspeedshop.<platform>.rpm

   If you don't have root and want to install via cpio
   for each rpm
     rpm2cpio <product>.rpm > <product>.cpio
     move <product>.cpio to a location from where it will
       install it's OPENSSROOT_PREFIX path
     cpio -i --make-directories < <product>.cpio



set additional envronment variables
   setenv PATH $PATH:/<path for initial support product install>/<bin>
    or
   export PATH=$PATH:/<path for initial support product install>/<bin>


You are now ready to execute OpenSpeedShop
