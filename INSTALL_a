Please see the BuildInstallGuide.txt for the latest build
and install information.  That document is based on the information
below and has enhanced information.

Both documents have valid Open|SpeedShop-1.9.3.3 release information.


THE INTENT:

This directory setup and install script is intended to
make the build and installation of the components that 
are needed to support Open|SpeedShop and Open|SpeedShop
itself easier.

Because Open|SpeedShop depends on components that are
highly dependent on Operating System interfaces and
libraries, it is difficult to produce executable rpms
for installation.  This is why we offer a source
build installation.

PREREQUISITE NEEDS:

There are some prerequisite packages that are necessary
for building and running the Open|SpeedShop performance tool.
Most will be present on a system that is used for debugging and
performance analysis.  The README file in this directory lists
the components and the versions that have been used successfully
with Open|SpeedShop.

INSTALLATION INFO:

Please gunzip and untar the openspeedshop-release-1.9.3.3.tar.gz
file and change directory into the openspeedshop-release-1.9.3.3
directory.   

example:
gunzip openspeedshop-release-1.9.3.3.tar.gz
tar -xvf openspeedshop-release-1.9.3.3.tar
cd openspeedshop-release-1.9.3.3

Inside that directory is the key script, install.sh,
that can be used in building the Open|SpeedShop performance tool.

The script, install.sh, can either step you through building
the support libraries and Open|SpeedShop or you can choose an
option (9) that will do all the steps without user intervention.

This process builds RPMs for each package and allows you the 
option of installing via RPM or to install as non-root through a
rpm to cpio process that is built into the script.  The default 
installation path is /opt/OSS

If you would like to install in another location, set the
environment variable OPENSS_PREFIX.  We recommend setting the
variable.  You can base your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH variables
off the OPENSS_PREFIX variable when you have Open|SpeedShop built
and you are ready to run it.

example:
export OPENSS_PREFIX=/usr/projects/OSS

Another variable that is advisable to set is QTDIR for the location
to the QT library if different from the default.  The default is 
/usr/lib64/qt-3.3

Additional (optional) environment variables needed for 
building vampirtrace and configuring for MPI experiments.
vampirtrace needs a MPI implementation specified in order
to be built.  So, the intent is to be able to run vampirtrace
trace under Open|SpeedShop, then one of the following MPI
implementations must be specified.  

   OPENSS_MPI_LAM  set to MPI LAM installation directory
   OPENSS_MPI_LAMPI  set to MPI LAMPI installation directory 
   OPENSS_MPI_OPENMPI  set to MPI OPENMPI installation directory
   OPENSS_MPI_MPICH  set to MPI MPICH installation directory
   OPENSS_MPI_MPICH2  set to MPI MPICH2 installation directory
   OPENSS_MPI_MPICH_DRIVER mpich/mpich2 driver name [ch-p4]
   OPENSS_MPI_MPT  set to SGI MPI MPT installation directory
   OPENSS_MPI_MVAPICH  set to MPI MVAPICH installation directory
   OPENSS_MPI_MVAPICH2  set to MPI MVAPICH2 installation directory

If the above variables are not set most Open|SpeedShop experiments 
will work, but the mpi, mpit, mpiotf experiments will not be built.
These variables are not necessary to run pcsamp, usertime, hwc, io,
or fpe experiments. 

The install script and the Open|SpeedShop configuration code will
read these environment variables and if set will configure Open|SpeedShop
to recognize these MPI implementations.  That will allow users the
ability to create MPI experiments (mpi, mpit, mpiotf) and gather 
performance data for MPI applications built with the specific 
MPI implementation (for example: openmpi).  

example:
export OPENSS_MPI_OPENMPI=/usr/projects/openmpi-1.2.4

The spec files associated with this build process include:
qtver=3.3.8b
libelfver=0.8.5_a
libdwarfver=20091230_a
libunwindver=20100123_a
papiver=3.7.0_a
sqlitever=3.6.22_a
monitorver=20090602_a
vampirtracever=5.3.2_a
dyninstver=6.1_a
mrnetver=2.2_a
openspeedshopver=1.9.3.3_a

There is an order that is required in building the
components because some of the components depend on
each other.  The install script will lead you through the process.

There is an expectation that you have libelf available. Option 1
will check and build if necessary and option 1a will install if 
you are doing the non-root cpio process.

To start, type:

./install.sh

These are the options that are provided. 

For the most automated way to build the entire tool would be to 
choose option: 9.  With this option all the components and openspeedshop
will be built and installed into the location/path specified in your
OPENSS_PREFIX environment variable.

If you have trouble using option 9, you can build the components and 
openspeedshop in a step by step manner to find any issues.  After each 
step you will need to run ./install.sh again to get to the next step.
You may also type install.sh and choose option 8 to see which
component is not installed.  You may only have to rebuild from that
component onward.

Because Open|SpeedShop currently uses dpcl as it's communication 
mechanism, a dpcl daemon must run on your machine and, if you have
a cluster, a dpcl daemon must run on each node of your cluster.
We have a default file named "site.py" that we will install
during the running of the install.sh script.  The site.py file
will work without intervention on your single system image machine,
like a pc or laptop (or a SGI single system image (SSI) machine).
If you going to run Open|SpeedShop on a cluster, some tweaking of
the site.py file may be necessary.  

See the startup_files subdirectory in this directory for example
site.py files that are working on cluster machines at various sites.

need assistance.

 
This is what will be displayed when you type install.sh:

    This script builds RPMs and supports installation as non-root through cpio
    
    The default install prefix is /opt/OSS. If another is preferred, please set
    the OPENSS_PREFIX environment variable to reflect the new target directory   
     
    If you plan on installing RPMs as root, it will let you know at what point
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    You are building for default MRNet Open|SpeedShop instrumentor: mrnet.
    If you wish to change the Open|SpeedShop instrumentor, use
    the OPENSS_INSTRUMENTOR to specify: mrnet, or offline.

   
   
    Checking for prerequisite components needed to build Open|SpeedShop and/or 
    the Open|SpeedShop required component packages. If all the prerequisite
    packages are present the script will continue, if not all the prerequisites
    are found, the script exits because the build will fail without the 
    prerequisite components installed.
    We are checking for these components:
        a) GNU patch
        b) libelf and/or libelf-devel
        c) libxml2 and/or libxml2-devel
           NOTE: libxml2 and/or libxml2-devel are not needed
                 if using OPENSS_INSTRUMENTOR=offline, however,
                 the online (mrnet) version does need libxml2 and libxml2-devel
        d) binutils and/or binutils-devel
        e) qt and/or qt-devel
        f) python and/or python-devel
        g) bison or flex
        h) libtool
        i) The environment variable QTDIR is set
        j) rpm
        k) libltdl and libltdl-devel

TO RUN:


To run Open|SpeedShop after you have completed the installation follow 
these steps.


1) Need to setup your module or set the necessary environment variables

  a)  DYNINSTAPI_RT_LIB=$OPENSS_PREFIX/lib64/libdyninstAPI_RT.so.1 
      OPENSS_PLUGIN_PATH=$OPENSS_PREFIX/lib64/openspeedshop 
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$OPENSS_PREFIX/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
      PATH=$OPENSS_PREFIX/bin:$PATH 
      ***** THESE ARE NECESSARY TO RUN openss 

      Note: DYNINSTAPI_RT_LIB is only required when
            running the online version of openss

  b) The most simple way to invoke the tool is to run it as an 
     immediate command, for example: 

        openss -f "executable_name" pcsamp
        or the equivalent convenience command:
        osspcsamp "executable_name"

     openss will run the executable and gather program counter sampling information
     for the executable named executable_name in offline mode and present the results
     to the screen and create an openss database file for post-mortem viewing.
     This mode of operation actually does three simple commands under the hood:
        expcreate, expgo, and expview
     which are needed to create the experiment, run the experiment and view 
     the performance statistics gathered by running the experiment.

  c) To invoke the running of the tool in GUI mode, type: “openss” 
     and follow the GUI wizard steps to create your performance statistics
     gathering experiment.  The GUI wizard guides you through all the steps
     to create, run and view the performance statistics.

  OR

  d) To invoke the tool in command line mode, type: "openss -cli"
     The tool then accepts commands (similar to gdb or dbx) interactively.
     Three simple commands are all that is needed to create, run, and
     view data.

     1) Create an experiment:

        expcreate -f <executable> pcsamp 
        expcreate -p <running pid> pcsamp  (only works with dynamic/online mode of operation)

     2) Run the experiment:

        expgo 

     3) View performance data from the experiment:

        expview 

     4) Get help

        help
        help commands

     5) Exit the tool

        quit
