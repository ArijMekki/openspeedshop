                Installing Open|SpeedShop from Source

This document describes the Installation process of Open|SpeedShop
from source. We recommend this kind of installation if the
RPMs provided on www.openspeedshop.org don't work for your
platforms, if you don't have the required permissions to install
RPMs into /usr, or if you would like to make changes to the 
Open|SpeedShop toolset itself.


Please see the INSTALL-note_a and README files in the 
OpenSpeedShop_ROOT development tree or the openspeedshop-release-r.n 
release tree for how to build and install into a non-root location.
