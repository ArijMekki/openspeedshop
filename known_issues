Legend * means fixed,
       - means still open.

- I/O collector doesn't support "-v" statements
  (error while double click on source during stacktrace)

* (dpm) Currently the tool does not support -v Statements for
  any of the tracing experiments (io,iot,mpi,mpit).
  Tracing experiments do not typically contain a sample address
  at an abritray line/address with in a function.
  The fix is to disable adding -v Statements to any command line
  generated by the GUI for tracing experiments.
  This does raise the issue on how to hightlight the lines in
  the user source (SourcePanel) where a trace occured.

- When displaying icons for various metrics (e.g. -V Statements),
  the icons displayed should match those available to a particular
  experiment. For example, the trace experiments do not support
  -v Statements and should not present that option as an icon.

- Clicking on a entry in a stacktrace in the StatsPanel does
  not focus the SourcePanel on the correct line for the event
  but rather on the first line of the enclosing function.

* (dpm) This is now fixed by having the GUI compute the
   lineNumber to focus on by using the Callstak element Value
   data rather than the getDefinitions data.

* (jeg) Bad times in stack trace data (usertime, I/O, ...)
   The fix went into the CLI, but Dave W. thinks this might
   be a framework issue.

* (jeg) Disable full path view didn't work during tutorial
   Jim investigated and this appears to be working in his
   version.

- MPI startup broken
        - Jim's system: can't execute
        - LLNL: - can't resume MPI job after attach
                  (test debug-0078)
                - stop process during right after attach
                  doesn't work right away (only with delay)

* (jeg) Record command broken
   Jim investigated and this appears to be working in his
   version.

- IA-64 memory corruption bug (also on other systems?)
  -> contact Dong Ahn for help with TV on thunder

- File not found box shows not the filename it tries to open
  (shown filename exists, but still can't open file)

* (dpm) The shown filename is not the file that was actually requested
   but rather the last known opened file. The error was for the
   current file being opened (which did not exist) and therefore
   the sourcepanel should not do anything more than display
   the "file does not exist" string in it's label field.
   This should now be fixed.

- When selecting system source files, we open any file, but
  give no error

* (dpm) This appears related to the other SourcePanel focus
   issues where a source file does not exist (e.g. libc source files).
   In this case we just display "file does not exist" in the
   label field of the source panel in question.

* (jeg) fixed 12/27/06 After focus stats panel we should open stats panel, not
  as currently the source panel

* (jeg) added 12/27/06 Can't have multiple equal MPIs
  (at least need documentation about what changes)
  jeg - added README-mpi to top level source directory to explain mpi configurations

- FPE: x86-64 get only one SI code
  (fix display to clean it up at least)
  Nathan and Don are looking into how to report this to kernel
  developers

- GUI problem with PAPI selection?

- Can't attach a second collector to an experiment created
  by a wizard
  (jeg) additional info.  It can be done but one must be over a process
        in the manage process panel.  The GUI is picking up text and trying
        to match that text with processes and hosts.  When you hover and right
        mouse button down over a blank area the GUI doesn't know what the processes
        and hosts you want to associate with the new collector and doesn't add it.

* (jeg) added 12/27/08 Want the manageprocess panel brought up with the
  custom experiment

* (jeg) added 01/02/07 Need error message/warning when experiment doesn't create
  data (right now it's just a blank screen)

- Looks like the path remapping only applies to the first experiment.  I had multiple
  experiments up and did the path remapping from the 2nd experiments menu but only the
  first experiments path was changed.   jeg  1/5/2007

* (jeg) fixed 1/8/2007 The "no data samples" message was not being hidden, so if
        there was data to be displayed for the current instantiation of the experiment
        view, it would not be viewable.  Added re-initialization when the data was updated.
