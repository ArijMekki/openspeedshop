There should be 4-6 candidates:

First and foremost, none of the candidates should have seen Open/SpeedShop
prior to the study.   Do not taint the pool with hints or suggestions.

Suggestions for candidates.

The candidates should be split evenly into 2 types.   One type being
regular users of GUI performance/debugging/development tools.  The other
candidates, those who would normally use a command line interface to
access tools.  i.e.  The traditionaly power users.

The candidates can be either computers scientists/engineers or application
engineers (i.e. computation scientists/physicists).
