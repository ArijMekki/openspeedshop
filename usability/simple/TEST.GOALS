Estimated Time:
   Anticipated test time; 15 minutes.   Max test time; 25 minutes.

Task 1:
  Launch Open/SpeedShop and optionally load a target application.
  (named 'fred_calls_ted').
Reason:
  To see if the user can initiate the tool and (optionally) figure out how to 
  load an executable from the command syntax arguments or from the 
  main "File" menu.

Task 2:
  Figure out which experiment will show the routine in the
  application that is taking the most time.
Reason:
  To determine if the user can navigate the different experiments to find out
  where to start performance debugging.

Task 3:
  Actively select the experiment determined in Task 2.
Reason:
  To see if it's obvious that an experiment type needs to be selected before
  anything >other than running the program< will be accomplished.

Task 4:
  Associate the executable with the selected experiment.
Reason:
  To make the required association between an experiment and the executable.

Task 5:
  Pass/add the required command line arguments to the exectuable.
Reason:
  To determine if it's obvious how to pass command line arguments to 
  the executable.
  
Task 6:
  Run the experiment/executable.  (With the correct command
  line argurments.)
Reason: 
  To see if it's easy to launch (run) an program under the control of 
  and experiment.

Task 7:
  Determine the current state of the process.
Reason:
  To see if the "Status" field is obviuos to the user that it contains the 
  current status of the process under control of the experiment.

Task 8:
  Determine the user's comfortable with a default view being displayed
  at termination?
Reason:
  To determine if it's reasonable to volunteer a default report to the user
  with a default set of attributes.

Task 9:
  Give the default view (report).   Can the user determine how much time 
  the Top routines took?
Reason: 
  Does the report make any sense to the user.

Task 10:
  Display line numbers on the source.
Reason:
  To see if the user can find the panel specific menu's.

Task 11: 
  Display the Top Panel side by side with the Source Panel.
Reason: 
  To determine if the user can figure out how to split panel
  containers and drag-n-drop panels.   Accomplishing this will 
  clue us in if the user can easily understand how to manage
  the screen realestate.

Task 12:
   Save the report to a file for later viewing.
Reason:
   To see if the save menu item can be discovered and distinguished from
   the save data file.
