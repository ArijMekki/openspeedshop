                         ASSIGNMENT 2


Introduction:
-------------

For this assignment you'll be asked to do a few common
debugging tasks.  There are no time constraint, nor should you
feel there are any.   Please try to "think out loud" as you
work through these problems.   It will greatly help us understand
where our problems are.

Enjoy.


Step 1:
  Type the following command at the prompt:
    $ cd /home/tulip22/stipek/demo/usability/test2

Step 2:
  Type the following command at the prompt:
    $ make 

  This should have made the test case 'fred_calls_ted'.   It's a
  very simple 'c' example that has a few straight forward function
  calls and a few variables.   This test case is nearly identical to 
  the previous task, but it's been broken up into 5 separate files.

Step 3:
  Run the executable 'fred_calls_ted'.   The output is 2 simple lines.

  Type:
    $ fred_calls_ted
    Set a breakpoint at this line.
    The final value of small_array[9,9]=0
    $

Step 4:
  SGI's debugger is named 'cvd'.    'man cvd' gives you the
  typical IRIX description of the command.


Step 5:
  Bring up the debugger, cvd, so you can debug the executable
  named 'fred_calls_ted'.


Step 6:
  Run the program (under the control of cvd).

 Does the output from this run match the output from the previous
  run?	 (From Step 3.)


Step 7:
  Set a breakpoint at the line, near the end of the file, that has
  the printf with the message, "Set a breakpoint at this line.".


Step 8:
  At line 13, main calls the function foo.   Set a breakpoint in
  function 'foo'.


Step 9:
  There's a file called 'fred.c'.   Load fred.c into the source view and set a 
  breakpoint at line 29.


Step 10:
  Run to the breakpoint at line 29 of 'fred.c'.


Step 11:
  What routine called fred()?   That is what's the call stack for
  this current program counter?


Step 12:
  Continue to the last line of the program.  (HINT:  That's the first
  breakpoint you set in main() at line 17 in fred_calls_ted.c.)


Step 13:
  Display the contents of the variable small_array;   What's the value
  of element cell small_array[2][2]?


Step 14:
  Set the value of the cell offset 9,9 to 100.


Step 15:
  Continue until the program has completed.


Step 16: 
  What value was printed out to the 'execution view' for small_array[9,9]?
