                 Phase III Usability Study   5/24/06
         Conducted by Scott Cranford, Martin Shulz, and Al Stipek


It's amazing!  There's still room for improvement...  ;-)


Great candidates Scott.   Thanks for making the arrangements for 
all the candidates.  And thanks for their time and input.

Four candidates were chosen for the study conducted on 05/24/06.


This time the users were asked to do a much more difficult task
than in the previous 2 studies.    It was hit-or-miss on whether the
candidates completed the first half of the task.   However, the information
gained while watching their stuggles will greatly help move the GUI further
along to be easier to use.

In this study the users were asked to compare 2 runs of a benchmark
program (sweep3d).   The baseline data set was done without any
source modifications, using a User Time experiment of the complete execution
taking the default settings.    In the second data set, a artificial
performance degradation was inserted.  Again, a User Time experiment
was completed on the execution taking the default settings.

The users were then asked to see if they could determine which 
execution was most efficient (fastest).  They were asked to 
see if they could find the source of the problem, which was a large
dead loop in one of the routines.   

No one successfully completed (independently) the second half of the
experiment which was to customize a Stats Panel.    I believe they were
already fried from managing the first half.


Please feel free to correct/add/delete anything you interpreted differently.


Below is the summary (highlights) of the observations.   The
first section is, in my opinion, the big ticket items.   

1 - Experiment ids and especially cids (-c) are way too confusing for
    users and should be hidden as much as reasonably possible.

    o -c #, should be stripped from all headers.   Information
      tying the headers back to the "data file" should be added
      to all header information.

    o It's also suggested that the pool of experiment ids and cids
      be separated.   (When users saw the first experiment they
      loaded come out as 2, and the second one as 4, they (mostly)
      wondered why they were incremental.  ? adjacent?   They were
      expecting 1, 2.  (As would I.)

2 - The users all wanted summary information for each view.
    The study question itself may have been leading,
    because of the scenario was directly asking for this sort of data,
    but the information should be added as it will be relevant in many/most
    cases.  Especially when doing a compare.

3 - Remove the "focus" approach in the CompareExperimentsPanel
    and bring up an experiment panel for each experiment being
    compared.   For example: In the scenario for the usability
    study, once the user completed the CompareWizard, three panels
    should be displayed.  CompareExperimentPanel, UserTime for
    experiment 1, and UserTime for experiment 2.

    Additionally, menu items to bring these panels back up (in case
    the use closes them down) should be added.  Placing menu items
    in both the CompareExperimentsPanel and the relative Stats Panel
    should be adequate.

    Remove all the focus logic and menu items for going to source
    from the CompareExperimentsPanel.   Only have menu items
    related to the compare.   For now that would be:
      - Original Query
      - Show Source Lines Data  (was Query Statements)
      - Show Source Diff (to be added eventually)
      - Open Experiment #1 (data file name)
      - Open Experiment #2 (data file name)

4 - The online help needs to be relevent.  For this study, help
    was made available and many users went down the path.  
    Unfortunately, the help text still isn't ready for this sort
    of usage and needs major work.

5 - There was confusion in the Intro Wizard over how many and
    which selections should be made.   All candidates (fairly)
    quickly were able to figure this out, but it could be improved.

    Suggested fixes:
    Put additional titles around the selections.   i.e. "Select
    one of the following:"

    Group all the items to make it clear there is only one selection
    required.

    (See item 6 for related changes.)

    
6 - Add an additional wizard, for completeness, to load just one
    experiment data file.   Basically like the Compare Wizard with
    only one selection.  It will be a simple, straightforward wizard,
    but it will make the Intro Wizard more complete.

    Something like:
    [ ] Load 1 saved experiment   (Selection followed by simple wizard.)
    [ ] Compare 2 saved experments   (Selection followed by compare wizard.)
    [x] Attach or Run executable  (Additional selection indented required.)
        o pcsamp
        o usertime
        o ...



7 - Diff, diff, diff.  Every (EVERY) user wanted a source diff for
    the exeriment data, with performance annotations.


8 - The headings, in general, need more information "connecting"
    their meaning back to what is being presented.   

    If there is a compare being done, column headers should reflect
    better what (experiment) the column is associated with.   

    If the Stats Panel was generated from the Customize Stats Panel,
    the header should have some connection to the "Column #n" that
    generated it.  

    Certainly this can be accomplished with better labels, but also
    dynamic popup help could/should make this more understandable.

9 - Query Statements.  "Statements" had no meaning to users and 
    is too much of an internal word.   Use something, like
    "Query Source Lines" -or- "Show Source Lines".

10- There needs to be an easier way to generate a report, "Show by 
    Proceesses", from the reports (metric?) menu.   Some simple
    "Show Each,  "Show each by",  aka a "top' sort of command,
    allowing the user to provide a metric.  This would duplicate
    the functionality of the Customize Stats Panel, but would limit
    what the user would need to select as it would be experiment specific.
    It would further be easier for the user to understand as it 
    would use the same metric the user has currently in focus
    Stats Panel.

11- Each report needs a header describing the report.   A title that
    volunteers more information.

 
More minor, but important items:

1 - Add key (legend) to Source Panel so users know what the
    colors/markings mean.

2 - Don't bring up the Source Panel by default when selecting
    from the Stats Panel pids menu.

    This was very confusing... to users and shouldn't be done.

    Additionally, this was really leading the user down the wrong
    path.   The user was seeing the Source Panel pop up so much they
    believed the tool was trying to tell them there was a problem in
    the source file being displayed.

3 - (See 10 above.)  The user needs a clearer way of selecting
    pids to change the stats in a panel.   Also, it was unclear
    to the users that selecting pids was actually changing the
    data they were seeing.   (This may be learning process, but
    changing per column header help, header text, and "somehow"
    labeling the report better may aleviate much of this confusion.

4 - Customize Stats Panel makes a reference to "process set".   We're
    migrating away from this term.   Something more appropriate
    should takes it's place.

5 - The user brought up the Customize Stats Panel, from the Stats
    Panel.   They were looking at the Function view.   When going
    to the Stats Panel, they were expecting something "Function 
    View" related.   Context should be carried to the 
    Customize Stats Panel when invoked from the Stats Panel.

6 - The user was looking for a "top" like command for pids.
    This should be doable via the expCompare or expClusterView
    commands.

7 - All the pids should be selected in the Stats Panel pids menu
    by default.   Allow the user to go to zero, rather than giving
    them All when they've unselected everything.

Bugs:


1 - Progress bar is blank too often (mostly) when requesting new
    reports.

2 - When deleting an experiment (via the 'x') the user needs a
    "Cancel" option.

    Currently the options are "Yes" and "No".   There needs to be
    an "I didn't want to hit that button option."

3 - When selecting the MPI_SGI_shared_progress(), which is 
    in libmpi.so, we're taking the user to the wrong function.
    (sweep.f)   This maybe (likely?) is a dwarf issue.

4 - The graphical chart (Stats Panel) for "Show Statements" is not
    relevant and should be prevented from being displayed.

5 - Popup help text in Customize Stats Panel is wrong.   It suggests
    the user should try the Manage Processes Panel.   This text needs
    to be change to reflect correct help.

6 - Sort consistently.  A usertime compare sorts on exclusive_time.
    A usertime experiment sorts on inclusive_time.   These should
    be consistent.

7?- Sums in Function view don't seem to match other views calculations.
    Particularly the calltree? view's values.

8 - Change wording in Compare Wizard to:
    "From there," one will   ....   i.e. add a comma after the word "there".

9 - Difference column should show signed values.   The sort should be 
    done as an ABS, but the actual display should indicate the sign.

10- In the Stats Panel's column menu, the |Difference| column is missing.
    (This is the menu that allows the user to hide/read columns after
     the report has been generated.)

11- Hide statistics mode flag is wrong in the Stats Panel and requires
    multiple selections to get it to act correctly.

12- Intro Wizard sometime hangs around after experiment is loaded.


Other comments and requests:

1 - Help text in the Stats Panel could easily be made column 
    sensitive.   Help text could then be issued that would more 
    easily relate the data back to the metric being displayed.
    This, as well as, help text when hovering over the header
    text.

2 - One user wanted to "import" data while in the Source Panel.
    They brought up the source they were interested in and then 
    they wanted to do "queries" from there.   This could be 
    very useful as nearly all reports could be invoked off the
    Source Panel.

3 - User wants to source navigate via the Source Panel.  i.e. They
    had a function in the Source Panel that they wanted to "dive" 
    to, but couldn't.   Additionally, per function queries "could"
    be provided via the Source Panel when a user is over a function.

4 - Detail information about what/how a particular metric is calculated
    could be most useful.  This could be displayed in each reports popup
    help, not only title.  Additional wording could explain what the
    metric is showing.

5 - When generating a report that doesn't have a tree... remove the
    "ladder" from the list view.


6 - It's non-intuitive how add a process in the Customize Stats Panel.
    Several ways should be support. 

     - First we need a sloppy drop.  The current drop target is too 
       restrictive.
     - Needs to support multi select.
     - Needs "OK" button (Maybe "Add/Delete") to change the current list
       based on the highlighted item.
     - Should also support +/- for the "OK/Add/Delete" functionality.
     - The dialog should only show rank pids by default, and then 
       give the user and option via a toggle to show all processes.

7 - In the Customize Stats Panel, its not immediately clear what "Column #1"
    stands for.   I'm not sure, other than to add more popup help to make
    this more clear.  Anyone?

8 - In Status, when loading from a file, associate the experiment ids
    with the data file.   Something like:
    Experiment (id 2) from sweep3d-A.openss is being compared with
    experiment (id 4) sweep3d-B.openss.  (Or something more meaningful.)

9 - In Customize Stats Panel, when creating a new column copy the previous
    columns information.  See other comment 8 from the first section (above)
    for initial column settings.

10- Would like see toolbar for Stats Panel's important reports.
    This toolbar would be located just under the Stats Panel's tab, and above 
    the report.

11- Include directory names in the compare wizard to show what the directory
    of the loaded data file is...

12- When focusing from the Customize Stats Panel, tie the column headers 
    in the Stats Panel, to the "Column #" that it was generated from.

13- Truncate, shrink, wrap column tabs when too many columns have been added
    and the < > arrows start to require the user to scroll tabs.

14- Put "Cancel" button on each wizard panel to allow the user to abort out.
    (This may likely have prevented the user from overloading the tab panel
     with so many tabs.  Of course the user could have simply done an 'x', but
     they hadn't yet discover that functionality.   "Cancel" gives another
     meaningful way out.)

15- When fielding a request to open an experiment for a second time, and 
    that experiment is already loaded, prompt the user to make sure they 
    want another one raise.  (NOTE: This sort of relates to a 'recycle' 
    functionality.   hmmm.)

16- Change the wording for the "Recycle" flag to "Recycle Window" or 
    "Recycle Panel".

17- Consider making "File->Open Exising Experiment" into a panel.  This
    has navigational features as well that may be very useful to an 
    advanced user who wants to manage many open panels.

18- Scott was "concerned" about a sluggish feel to the tool.  I think
    there's ample room to improve this but we're still so busy adding
    functionality.
