                         Usability Study


Introduction:
-------------

For this assignment you'll be asked to analyze some performance
output from a previously executed performance expeiment..  

There is no time constraint to "correctly" complete this task.

Please try to "think aloud" as you work through the scenario.   
It will help us understand where our problems are.

Your work is to perform the two tasks below.   In brief, the first task is 
to compare the data files collected from two separate runs of the
program (nbody).   You do not have to run this application, the data has
already been gathered.   The second task will be analyze one of the 
experiments to determine which process is taking the most time and why.


Remember:  You are not being tested.    The user interface and it's
ease of use, is being analyzed.   Your initial feedback and thoughts as you 
navigate through this set of tasks will enable us to see our problem
areas.


Open|SpeedShop is a tool designed by SGI in cooperation with several national
labs.   The executable is, "openss".   There is a man page, "man openss".

Enjoy.




The Scenario:
------------

There are 2 data files X1.nbody_mpiA.openss and X2.nbody_mpiB.openss that
are from 2 executions.  Both used the pc Sampling experiment, sampling
data with the default settings.   


Both versions of the experiment get the correct answers.  There was an
'obvious' algorithm change that caused one version of the program to run
slower than the other.


The first task is to determine which of the 2 versions of the experiment
actually runs the most efficient.  (Fastest)

The second part of the task is to determine why the slower down occured.
HUGE HINT: One thread took much more time due to algorithm change.   Can you 
find which process took the longest and why?



Step 1:
  From the 2 data files in the current directory, determine which execution
took the least time to run.  i.e. Which one ran the fastest, using the least
amount of cpu time.  (In this test case, the one using the least amount
off cpu time also took the shortest amount of wall-clock time.)


Step 2 is based on your answer in Step 1.
Step 2:
  ... more words ...
  Determine which thread of the slower algorithm took the most time.

Step n:
  Exit the Open|Speedshop tool.
