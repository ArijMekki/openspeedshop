                         Usability Study


Introduction:
-------------

For this assignment you'll be asked to 

There is no time constraint to "correctly" complete this task.

Please try to "think aloud" as you work through the scenario.   
It will help us understand where our problems are.

Remember:  You are not being tested.    The user interface and it's
ease of use, is being analyzed.   Your initial feedback and thoughts as you 
navigate through this set of tasks will enable us to see our problem
areas.


Open|SpeedShop was designed by SGI in cooperation with several national
labs and is now being supported by the Krell Institute.   

The executable is, "openss".   
There is a man page, "man openss".

Thanks!




The Scenario:
-------------

In this directory there is a subdirectory named lampi where a LA-MPI version
of sweep3d compiled with the PGI 6.1-3 compiler is located.  The sweep3d source
was modified to contain an algorithm change that degrades performance for one
of the ranked processes.

In general we're asking you to run OpenSpeedShop on this version of sweep3d using
the OpenSpeedShop graphical user interface (GUI) and to try to determine where
the performance problem is occurring.  

Typically, and in this case sweep3d.mpi is launching using the mpirun command
in a form such as this: mpirun -np 8 sweep3d.mpi.


The Assignment:
---------------

Step 1:

From the lampi subdirectory, launch the OpenSpeedShop GUI.

Step 2:

Using the OpenSpeedShop wizard launch the sweep3d.mpi
executable using the lampi mpirun (present in the current working
directory)

We want to determine what part of the sweep3d program is 
taking the most time and which routines call the routines that are
degrading performance.


Step 3:

Once the sweep3d.mpi application completes use the 
StatsPanel available options to determine if any of the
ranked processes are taking more time than the others.

Step 4:

Determine which routine is the most likely to have caused 
the performance degradation.


Step 5:

Determine which routine called the routine which caused the
degradation.


Step 6:

Save the results file, for future analysis.


Step n:
  Exit the Open|Speedshop tool.
