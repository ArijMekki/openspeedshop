                         Usability Study


Introduction:
-------------

For this assignment you'll be asked to 

There is no time constraint to "correctly" complete this task.

Please try to "think out loud" as you work through the scenario.   
It will help us understand where our problems are.

Remember:  You are not being tested.    The user interface and it's
ease of use, is being analyzed.   Your initial feedback and thoughts as you 
navigate through this set of tasks will enable us to see our problem
areas.


Open|SpeedShop was designed by SGI in cooperation with several national
labs and is now being supported by the Krell Institute.   

The executable is, "openss".   
There is a man page, "man openss".

Thanks!




The Scenario:
-------------

In this directory there is a subdirectory named lampi where a LA-MPI version
of sweep3d compiled with the PGI 6.1-3 compiler is located.  The sweep3d source
was modified to contain an algorithm change that degrades performance for one
of the ranked processes.

In general we're asking you to run OpenSpeedShop on this version of sweep3d using
the OpenSpeedShop graphical user interface (GUI) and to try to determine where
the performance problem is occurring.  

Typically, and in this case sweep3d.mpi is launching using the mpirun command
in a form such as this: mpirun -np 8 sweep3d.mpi.


The Assignment:
---------------

Step 1:

From the lampi subdirectory, launch the OpenSpeedShop GUI.

Note: We will have to intervene once you have launched OpenSpeedShop
      because OpenSpeedShop isn't fully automated for starting multiprocess
      jobs.  This happens before step 2.


Step 2:

Using the OpenSpeedShop wizard launch the sweep3d.mpi
executable using the lampi mpirun (present in the current working
directory)  If you are not familar with lampi mpi.  The typical command
to launch mpi jobs is "mpirun -np <process number> executable"

We want to determine what part of the sweep3d program is 
taking the most time.


Step 3:

When the experiment completes the Stats Panel will pop up.

After that happens can you determine which routine is the 
taking the most time.  Is it in the sweep3d application?  
Where is it's source file located?


Step 4:

The default way of the displaying the performance data in the
StatsPanel is "by function".  Can you display the performance 
data "by statements"?


Step 5:

Use one of the StatsPanel available options to determine if any of the
ranked processes are taking more time than the others.

Hint: It's a one step process.


Step 6:

Are there any conclusions that can be made from the comparision
view you are at as a result of Step 5?


Step 6:

Save the results file, for future analysis.


Step n:
  Exit the Open|Speedshop tool.
