p_tupdate this tree....

From the .../current directory type:
$ ./mc
This will configure and build the GUI portion of OpenSpeedShop.
When the build completes you should be able to run.  The script to 
launch the tool is openss.  (Also located in the .../current directory.)
$ openss
If openss fails to execute, check to make sure the OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_DIR
is set to the install location.  The default setting for
OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_DIR is usually: .../current/plugin/lib/openspeedshop

On hope.americas.sgi.com, mine is set to:
$ set | grep OPENS
OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_DIR=/home/tulip22/stipek/OpenSpeedShop/current/current/plugin/lib/openspeedshop

$ openss --help 
Gives a simple usage command.


To make the doxygen documentation: (again from the .../current directory)
# make doc


The interesting GUI environment variables are:
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR=~/oss/install
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_PATH=$OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR/lib/openspeedshop
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_PATH
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_ENTRY_POINT=gui_init
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_RELOCATABLE_NAME=ossgui.so
PATH=.:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:$OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR/bin:$OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR:$PATH
