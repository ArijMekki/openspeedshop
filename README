Open|SpeedShopâ„¢ Source Access Information

The Open|SpeedShop product consists of an "OpenSpeedShop" cvs 
repository for the primary Open|SpeedShop code, including the 
framework and user interface,  and the "OpenSpeedShop_ROOT" 
cvs repository which includes supporting components which may, 
or may not, already be installed on the system.   Two supporting 
components, DPCL and Dyninst, must be installed from the OpenSpeedShop_ROOT 
repository.   These two components are not available anywhere else at this 
point.  They are provided in RPM and SRPM form.  

There are two ways to access the OpenSpeedShop  and OpenSpeedShop_ROOT code.

    * SGI Releases
      SGI provides a more stable release than the nightly cvs source 
      tree.  These release(s) can be found in the download area
      on oss.sgi.com/openspeedshop

    * CVS trees
      Direct CVS access to the most recent OpenSpeedShop changes. See below.

Using CVS trees

CVS for new users contains links to general CVS documentation.

Set the CVSROOT environment variable.

$ export CVSROOT=':pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/oss/CVS_OpenSpeedShop'
(for sh, bash, ksh, or similar shells)
$ setenv CVSROOT  :pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/oss/CVS_OpenSpeedShop
(for csh or tcsh shells)
 

Login to the CVS server (this only needs to be done ONCE, not every time you access CVS).

$ cvs login
(the password is "cvs")
 

Now grab the OpenSpeedShop and OpenSpeedShop_ROOT source trees: 

$ cvs checkout OpenSpeedShop
$ cvs checkout OpenSpeedShop_ROOT
 

Subsequently, you can checkout new code using: 

$ cvs update -d
 

export OPENSS_INSTALL_DIR=/tmp/OpenSpeedshop
PATH=$PATH:.:$OPENSS_INSTALL_DIR/bin


Do the following commands in the OpenSpeedShop directory:

Open|SpeedShop uses automake/autoconf in it's build process.  
The sequence used to build Open|SpeedShop is as follows:

    * # Go to the Open|SpeedShop top level source directory
    * cd <openspeedshop source directory>
    * # Create initial build files
    * bootstrap
    * # Configure Open|SpeedShop with or without optional installation directory designation
    * configure [--prefix=<Open|SpeedShop Install Directory Path>]
    * # Make and install Open|SpeedShop
    * make install


This will configure and build the GUI and framework portion of OpenSpeedShop.
When the build completes you should be able to run.  The script to 
launch the tool is openss. 
$ openss

$ openss --help 
Gives a simple usage command.
