p_tupdate this tree....

From the .../GUI directory type:
$ ./mc
This will configure and build the GUI portion of OpenSpeedShop.
When the build completes you should be able to run.  The script to 
launch the tool is openss.  (Also located in the .../GUI directory.)
$ openss
If openss fails to execute, check to make sure the OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_DIR
is set to the install location.  The default setting for
OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_DIR is usually: .../GUI/plugin/lib/openspeedshop

On hope.americas.sgi.com, mine is set to:
$ set | grep OPENS
OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_DIR=/home/tulip22/stipek/OpenSpeedShop/current/GUI/plugin/lib/openspeedshop

$ openss --help 
Gives a simple usage command.


To make the doxygen documentation: (again from the .../GUI directory)
# mkdoc
