The interesting environment variables are:
. /perftools/ROOT/setenv.sh
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR=/tmp/OpenSpeedshop
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_PATH=$OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR/lib/openspeedshop
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_GUI_ENTRY_POINT=gui_init
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_CLI_ENTRY_POINT=cli_init
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_GUI_RELOCATABLE_NAME=ossgui.so
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_CLI_RELOCATABLE_NAME=posscli.so
PATH=$PATH:.:$OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR/bin


Set up your .workarea and from the directory named "current" directory type:
$ p_tupdate
$ ./mc
This will configure and build the GUI and framework portion of OpenSpeedShop.
When the build completes you should be able to run.  The script to 
launch the tool is openss. 
$ openss

$ openss --help 
Gives a simple usage command.


To make the doxygen documentation: (again from the .../current directory)
# make doc
