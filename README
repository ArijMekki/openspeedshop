First you need to pull down and build a $ROOT.    (On hope there's one
already
built in /perftools/ROOT .

hope.americas.sgi.com$ pwd
/data/clink/tools/builds/perftools
hope.americas.sgi.com$ ls
autoconf-2.59.tgz    dpcl-dyninst-hybrid-20040617.tgz  qt-3.3.1.tgz
automake-1.7.9.tgz   gcc-3.3.3.tgz                     setenv.csh
binutils-2.14.tgz    libdwarf-20040203.tgz             setenv.sh
boost_1_31_0.tar.gz  libelf-0.8.5.tgz                  tmake-1.11.tgz
Build-Hybrid         libtool-1.5.2.tgz                 xxdiff-3.0.2.tgz
Build-ROOT           libunwind-0.96-uwmadison.tgz
doxygen-1.3.6.tgz    Python-2.3.4.tgz

$ su
Password: xxxxxxxxxx
# cd /
# mkdir /perftools
# chmod 777 /perftools
exit
$ cd /perftools
$ rcp clink.americas.sgi.com:/data/clink/tools/builds/perftools/* .
$ ./Build-ROOT /perftools/ROOT /perftools
(Wait a very long time...)
$ cd

The interesting environment variables are:
. /perftools/ROOT/setenv.sh
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR=/tmp/OpenSpeedshop
export OPENSPEEDSHOP_PLUGIN_PATH=$OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR/lib/open-speedshop
# You only need to set the following four entry points if you've
# overridden them...
# export OPENSPEEDSHOP_GUI_ENTRY_POINT=gui_init
# export OPENSPEEDSHOP_CLI_ENTRY_POINT=cli_init
# export OPENSPEEDSHOP_GUI_RELOCATABLE_NAME=ossgui.so
# export OPENSPEEDSHOP_CLI_RELOCATABLE_NAME=posscli.so
PATH=$PATH:.:$OPENSPEEDSHOP_INSTALL_DIR/bin


Set up your .workarea and from the directory named "current" directory type:
$ p_tupdate
$ ./mc
This will configure and build the GUI and framework portion of OpenSpeedShop.
When the build completes you should be able to run.  The script to 
launch the tool is openss. 
$ openss

$ openss --help 
Gives a simple usage command.


To make the doxygen documentation: (again from the .../current directory)
$ make doc
$ export OPENSPEEDSHOP_DOC_DIR=<path_to_current_dir>/current/doc
(Or whereever the documentation was moved to...)
By default this is in the workarea/current/doc directory.
