Release 1.9.2 is a bug fix update to Release 1.9.1 of OpenSpeedShop.  So, all the information about
Releases 1.9 and 1.9.1 applies to the 1.9.2 release also.

Release 1.9.1 is a bug fix update to Release 1.9 of OpenSpeedShop.  So, all the information about
Release 1.9 applies to the 1.9.1 release also.

Release 1.9 of OpenSpeedShop introduces a new "offline" mode of operation.  By offline,
we mean that we use linker based instrumentation, not the dynamic instrumentation Open|SpeedShop
has used in the past.  Online instrumentation is still available in Open|SpeedShop, although
using the offline mode of operation is strongly recommended for the 1.9 version of Open|SpeedShop.
There are still issues with online instrumentation as we move from using DPCL to using MRNet as
our cluster node network management package.

We recommend running Open|SpeedShop (openss is the command) in the "-offline" mode.  This will
create an Open|SpeedShop database file from which the performance data can be viewed postmortem.
The command to view the data is:
   GUI: openss -f <database file name>
   CLI: openss -cli -f <database file name>, then enter the "expview" command

You may consult the Open|SpeedShop Users Guide or Quick Start Guide for more information.
These are available on the Open|SpeedShop web site: openspeedshop.org or in the installation
directory in <install_dir_path>/share/doc/packages/OpenSpeedShop/users_guide.

Here is an example listed by steps:

1) RUN openss -offline to gather the data:
   This command attached the Open|SpeedShop performance data collectors specified by the experiment type
   (pcsamp) in this example, to the nbody mpi application and runs the application.  The output from the
   application comes to the screen as well as the Open|SpeedShop information messages and performance data
   default report.   A database file containing the performance data and all the necessary information to 
   view the performance information postmortem is created.

prompt:>openss -offline -f "/opt/openmpi-1.2.4/bin/orterun -np 2 nbody" pcsamp
[openss]: Using OPENSS_PREFIX installed in /opt/OSS-mrnet
[openss]: Setting up offline raw data directory in /tmp/jeg/offline-oss

2) The above command also created an Open|SpeedShop database file for postmortem viewing with optional ways to view
   the performance data.   A "ls" command shows that the database file name is X.0.openss.

ls -lastr *.openss  
  52 -rw-r--r-- 1 jeg jeg   46080 2008-11-14 08:43 X.0.openss

3) You may view the database in the Open|SpeedShop graphical user interface (GUI) with the command:  openss -f X.0.openss
   Then select the StatsPanel tab to see the default results.  There is a toolbar which contains numerous icons which'
   represent alternative views of the performance data.

4) You may view the database in the Open|SpeedShop interactive command line user interface (CLI) with 
   the command:  openss -cli -f X.0.openss
   
   a) The default view:

prompt>openss -cli -f X.0.openss
