<h1><a name="mozTocId885503" class="mozTocH1"></a><small>October 25,
2004 Meeting Comments and Questions</small></h1>
<h2><a name="mozTocId335773" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C1: MPI
Considered<br>
</small></h2>
It wasn't clear that starting or attaching to MPI jobs
was considered when the commands were defined. Also,
we would like a way of specifying a cluster name. It
appears that only hosts are allowed in the current syntax.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId653856" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R1: MPI
Considered<br>
</small></h2>
We will look at this and determine what is missing.
<br>
<br>
---
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId122429" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C2: Comparison
Question<br>
</small></h2>
Will there be a facility to allow comparison of different
ranks/processes to other ranks in the same application?
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId737898" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R2: Comparison
Question</small>
</h2>
Yes - there will be a comparison utility that will allow
users to compare different ranks, processes, or threads to
each other.
<br>
<br>
---
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId740862" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C3:
Asynchronous Run Question<br>
</small></h2>
a) Does expRun wait until the experiment is finished running?
<br>
b) If not, can you implement a wait command?
<br>
c) If you implement a wait command can it be interrupted?
<br>
d) How do you know the status of your experiment/job?
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId316275" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R3:
Asynchronous Run Question<br>
</small></h2>
a) No, expRun and expCont are asynchronous. There may be an option
to run synchronously. It will run synchronously in batch mode.
<br>
b) We could implement a wait command if necessary.
<br>
c) We recommend keeping the specification as is. The information
telling us the experiment is complete will be &nbsp; available from the
listExp command and we could provide &nbsp; a function (or additional
command) that would force a wait.
Perhaps we could have two expRun commands:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; expRun - synchronous
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; expRunA - asynchronous
<br>
<br>
Also, for batch commands, not waiting until "expRun" is done running
won't make any sense because the script won't know when it is
done.
<br>
<br>
d) The expList command will return the status of your experiment/job.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId80071" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C4: expFocus
Question<br>
</small></h2>
a) The use of the expFocus command is not clear - what does it do?
<br>
b) What about having an optional argument to expCreate that will
associate a name with the experiment? This would help users
identify their experiments easier.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId928185" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R4: expFocus
Question<br>
</small></h2>
a) The expFocus command will focus the command line tool
on the experiment that corresponds to the experiment
number used as input to the command. So, if you are creating
multiple experiments, each expCreate command will
create it's own unique experiment identifier. The
expFocus command will make the experiment you specify the
"default" or "focused" experiment.
<br>
b) We can look at the optional name proposal and see if that
causes any difficulty to implement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also mentioned, was the
idea
that the user could assign the result of an expCreate to a Python
variable.
That variable would act just like a user provided name on the command
would and doesn't require any change to the specification. We think
this
would be the preferred solution.
<br>
<blockquote type="cite">bosco = expCreate -f my_prog -x pcsamp
  <br>
print bosco
  <br>
5
  <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
You can refer to the experiment as either "bosco" or 5.&nbsp;
Internally "bosco" gets resolved to 5 so all is well.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId795664" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C5: "::" will
cause Python Problems<br>
</small></h2>
The "::" characters in the expParam definition will cause
Python parsing problems. &lt;expParam&gt; = &lt;expType&gt; ::
&lt;parameter&gt;
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId733533" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R5: "::" will
cause Python Problems</small>
</h2>
We know we will hit some of these issues. We just haven't
gotten that far yet. Thanks for pointing this out to us.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId587386" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C6: listExp
dual uses and listTypes suggestion<br>
</small></h2>
The listExp command gives both the status of the active
experiments and the list of the inactive (unused) experiments.&nbsp;
We would like a command that gives the available experiments
(active and inactive). We suggest listTypes be used as the
command name. Then only have listExp deal with active
experiment information.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId602913" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R6: </small><small>listExp
dual uses and listTypes suggestion</small></h2>
Yes - we will look into doing this.
<br>
<br>
---
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId637355" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C7: What
happens to the CLI window when launching the GUI?</small>
</h2>
a) What happens when you are running the CLI and then
launch the GUI - what happens to the CLI window? Is
it still active?
<br>
b) You probably wouldn't be using both windows in a session.
<br>
You'd use either the GUI or CLI only.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId724970" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R7: </small><small>What
happens to the CLI window when launching the GUI?</small></h2>
a) You may not get a command window in the GUI, but the invoking
shell would effectively become the CLI window.
<br>
b) There are times when you may be working remote and would
like to use the command line for most of the session and
then when you have complicated results to view - bring up
the GUI for that purpose. We are still thinking about how
the GUI and CLI interact, e.g. affect each other's focus.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId865448" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C8: Saving and
Restoring the Experiment</small>
</h2>
a) I don't see a command to save the experiment.
<br>
b) What about restoring the experiment?
<br>
c) Can I restore and then continue the experiment from there?
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId623478" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R8: </small><small>Saving
and Restoring the Experiment</small></h2>
a) That is the expSave command.
<br>
b) The expRestore command is responsible for that.
<br>
c) Right now the expRestore command will only allow you to
view the existing data. We have the symbol info, the
names of the executable(s), and the experiment data.
<br>
<br>
However, with out Linux checkpoint/restart capabilities
we don't have any process state information, etc..
This could be an enhancement after the first release, if
a standard checkpoint/restart functionality exists.
<br>
<br>
UPDATE from Open/SpeedShop group meeting discussion: This is different
than the checkpoint/restart issue
but it may be what some users will want to do. It may be possible to do
attach and detach cycles
of data gathering as long as the original application is still
running.&nbsp; The user could:
<br>
<br>
run-1.a) Open the Open/SpeedShop tool
<br>
run-1.b) Run the experiment of their choice
<br>
run-1.c) Save the performance data
<br>
run-1.d) Shutdown the Open/SpeedShop tool
<br>
<br>
The user could then come back a day or a week later and if the original
application is still running:
<br>
<br>
run-2.a) Open the Open/SpeedShop tool
<br>
run-2.b) Restore the data files from 1st run
<br>
run-2.c) Attach to the application and run the experiment again
<br>
run-2.d) Save the performance data
<br>
run-2.e) Aggregate the data from the two runs run-2.f) Create a report
or view the performance data
<br>
run-2.g) Shutdown the Open/SpeedShop tool <br>
Then repeat the cycle if desired.
<br>
This would be a follow on enhancement feature.

<h2><a name="mozTocId534409" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C9:&nbsp; How
do you stop gathering data for a period of time?<br>
</small></h2>
a) How do you stop gathering data for a period of time - expDetach?
<br>
b) Will the instrumentation be taken out of the experiment targeted
application? Does expDetach do that?
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId411470" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R9: </small><small>How
do you stop gathering data for a period of time?</small></h2>
a) There is a parameter that can be set via the expSetParam command
that can enable gathering and also disable gathering.&nbsp;
Perhaps creating expEnable and expDisable commands would be
more intuitive?
<br>
b) We had some discussion of this during the meeting and it seemed
to make sense that there would be a command that would allow
<br>
the user to just enable/disable gathering if they user was
going to be enabling and disabling during a short time frame
for a long running application. If the user was gathering
data every other day on a very long running application it would
be nice to have a command that takes out the instrumentation
when not gathering so the application can run at it's full
possible speed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would like to wait on this until we
better understand what the framework functionality will be.
<br>
<br>
UPDATE from Open/SpeedShop group meeting discussion:
<br>
For a given collector, it is expensive to load the probe module
dso into the application.&nbsp; So, for start gathering and stop
gathering
operations, leave the probe module loaded but take out the
instrumentation
that calls into the probe module(s).
<br>
<br>
Have the attach operation load the probe module(s) and the detach
unload the probe module(s).
<br>

<h2><a name="mozTocId556590" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C10: CLI
Command naming questions<br>
</small></h2>
The command names with "exp" and "list" prefixes are good.&nbsp;
All the other commands do not have a prefix. This may causes
Python collisions. Can we use "oss" as a prefix? Or another prefix?
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId609518" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R10: </small><small>CLI
Command naming questions</small></h2>
Yes, we have thought about this too. "oss" is probably not
a good choice because it is associated with "Open Source Software".
<br>
We are open to suggestions.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId754417" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>C11: "record"
command feature enhancement<br>
</small></h2>
The record command could have a "-python" logging option which could
save the commands as Python API. This could then be run as a
<br>
script.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="mozTocId877836" class="mozTocH2"></a><small>R11: </small><small>"record"
command feature enhancement</small></h2>
In the current design there isn't a singular place in the
code where the Python API is created. This might be difficult
to track.&nbsp; We would like to keep this as an open issue for now
and consider it again as we get farther along in the tool's
implementation.
