Open|SpeedShop 1.9.2 introduces additional &quot;short cut&quot; scripts that hide some of the underlying options for running the offline version of Open|SpeedShop.  These scripts hide the -f, -offline, and experiment specification options.

The new script names, which correspond to all the Open|SpeedShop experiments, are:

osspcsamp
ossusertime
osshwc
osshwctime
ossio
ossiot
ossmpi
ossmpit
ossmpiotf
ossfpe

For example, the command:

  osspcsamp &quot;executable&quot;

is equivalent to the long hand version of executing program counter sampling experiment on &quot;executable&quot;: 

  openss -offline -f &quot;executable&quot; pcsamp

This &quot;short cut&quot; method is true for all the other Open|SpeedShop experiments as well.

In addition to the above mentioned change, there are also additional options added to the &quot;short cut&quot; commands.  

The additional options (default, high, low, and input value(s)) are explained below in an experiment specific manner.


GENERAL usage rules for using the oss&lt;experiment_name&gt; scripts:

The script always will override the default experiment parameters and any environment variable settings that are related to the experiment parameters.  The script will warn when it overrides an experiment variable.

EXPERIMENT SPECIFIC rules for using the oss&lt;experiment_name&gt; scripts follow below.   Note that each numbered item under the experiment section indicates the usage syntax for the oss&lt;experiment_name&gt; script. 

PCSAMP

1) osspcsamp &quot;executable&quot;

If OPENSS_PCSAMP_RATE is not set, osspcsamp runs using the default sampling rate which is currently 100 samples per second.
If OPENSS_PCSAMP_RATE is set, osspcsamp runs using the sampling rate specified by the OPENSS_PCSAMP_RATE environment variable.

2) osspcsamp &quot;executable&quot; default

If OPENSS_PCSAMP_RATE is not set, osspcsamp runs using the default sampling rate which is currently 100 samples per second.
