<h1>GUI Interface Overview </h1>
<p>
</p>
<h3 align="center">1.0.0 </h3>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="intro_the_goal">The Goal</a></h2>
The goal of the GUI is to provide an intuitive, easy to use, portal to
an otherwise complex and overwhelming application. In the case of Open
Speed Shop, we are attempting to put an intuitive interface between the
user and their applications performance experiment. It's a layer that
will help the user ask the correct questions and get the correct
meaningful answer back regarding, "Where is my application spending all
its time and how can I make it go faster."
<p>One objective to this goal is to provide a GUI framework that will
provide common consistent base functionality. One that will prevent a
complex set of tools from getting window-itis, yet providing the user
with all the necessary control and clues/hints to achieve their end
goal. The GUI base will also provide the necessary flexibility to add
new functionality as other developers begin to develop add-ons
(plugins) to improve the core set of tools provided.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="intro_to_gui_section">The GUI Infrastructure</a></h2>
The GUI is broken into 3 basic parts. The Main Window, PanelContainers,
and Panels.
<h3><a class="anchor" name="intro_to_mainwindow">The Main Window</a></h3>
There is only one Main Window and it is the owner of the master <a
 class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a>.
There is only one master <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a>
and when it is closed, the GUI exits.
<p>The Main Window will handle high level commands like managing the
main menu toolbar. This menu bar is dynamically created from the list
of dynamic GUI plugins.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="intro_to_panel_containers">PanelContainers</a></h3>
The PanelContainers will provide all the underlying support for screen
layout, local menu management, dive management, drag-n-drop, and
communication broker.
<p>A <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a>
is an area (container) on the screen where Panels can be placed and
managed.</p>
<p>Each <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a>
will have a simple communication broker to allow Panels to communicate
between local and remote Panels.</p>
<p>A <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a>
is responsible for interacting with the user, via the <a class="el"
 href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a> menu, to add,
delete, resize, or move Panels.</p>
<p>A <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a>
can be split either horizontally or vertically into 2 PanelContainers.
A <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a> can
contain, one, many, or no Panels. A <a class="el"
 href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a> has no specific
knowledge of what a <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> is
doing. (i.e. I doesn't know anything about experiments. It just manages
the Panels space and any communication with other Panels.)</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="intro_to_panels">Panels</a></h3>
A <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> is where all the
nuts-n-bolts knowledge and logic exists for an individual task.
<p>They will handle <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a>
specific user interaction and interaction with the Framework.</p>
<p>A <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> is placed in a <a
 class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a>. Each <a
 class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> is managed by its <a
 class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanelContainer.html">PanelContainer</a>. A <a
 class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> is the base handle for all
views. That is each user defined <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a>
(i.e. performance experiment type) will have a <a class="el"
 href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> type derived from a base class <a
 class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a>. Examples of <a class="el"
 href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> types and their functions would be:</p>
<p></p>
<dl compact="compact">
  <dt><b>o Wizard Panel:</b></dt>
  <dd>The Wizard <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> would
be responsible for interviewing the user to aid them in selecting the
right performance tool for the job. After the interview process was
completed a command would be passed to the Framework for action. Upon
completion the user would be notified and an appropriate (default)
report (Experiment <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a>)
would be generated for the user. </dd>
</dl>
<dl compact="compact">
  <dt><b>o Top Panel:</b></dt>
  <dd>The Top <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> would be
responsible for displaying the top 'n' metrics from a Collector. It
would provide the implementation for fielding requests to find more
information about a selected item and for sending source position
updates to a Source <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a>. </dd>
</dl>
<dl compact="compact">
  <dt><b>o Source Panel</b></dt>
  <dd>The Source <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> would
be responsible for displaying source files to the screen. It would
provide functionality to display line numbers, search, highlight line
segments, and field dive request for more information about specific
lines. </dd>
</dl>
<dl compact="compact">
  <dt><b>o ...</b></dt>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
</dl>
Panels will look like a "tabbed" view. A <a class="el"
 href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> can be moved around to be placed near
other Panels for association (communication) to be granted. An example
of this could be a User Time <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a>
could be placed near and existing Source <a class="el"
 href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a>, when the user clicks on an object in
the User Time <a class="el" href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> that
relates to a source line, the nearest Source <a class="el"
 href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a> would be updated (repositioned) to
that source line.
<h2><a class="anchor" name="intro_to_panel_plugins">Why Panel Plugins?</a></h2>
Panels will be loaded as plugins. It will be the MainWindow's
responsibility to locate and configure the GUI to interact with
whatever plugins are currently located on the system. The MainWindow's
menus will need to be dynamically configured based on the available
plugins. A plugin directory (directories) will exist with dynamic
libraries to be loaded. The dynamic libraries may be visible upon
loading, or later (on demand), depending on their type.
<p>Using plugin technology allows for ease of exending this tool in the
future. It also will keep this tool very lightweight as only the
functionality requested needs to be loaded.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="intro_to_gui_plugins">All The To-Do About
Dynamic GUI Plugins.</a></h2>
A dynamic plugin is a GUI component. A visible or hidden <a class="el"
 href="GUIbase/html/classPanel.html">Panel</a>. Each plugin includes the following
information to a common structure in the panel description.
<p>At initialization the default location (yet to be determined) or an
environment variable FUTURE_TOOL_PLUGIN_DIR is check for the available
plugins. Each plugin is openned and a menu structure is created from
the plugin header information.</p>
<p>Here's what the plugin header information contains:</p>
<p>local_plugin_info.h</p>

    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="intro_to_starting_gui">
Into To How The GUI Launches Itself.</a></h2>
The GUI is bundled into a dynamic library that is loaded on demand.
It's the *Command Line Interface (CLI) that launches the GUI. By
default the CLI will launch the GUI upon invocation of the <a
 class="el" href="libssf/html/namespaceOpenSpeedShop.html">OpenSpeedShop</a> tool.
However, the CLI can be started without starting the GUI ($ oss -cli)
and then the GUI can loaded and initialize when needed.
<p>Upon invoking <a class="el" href="libssf/html/namespaceOpenSpeedShop.html">OpenSpeedShop</a>
($ oss) the command line is parsed, and if the GUI is requested the GUI
library is loaded and launched. We then drop into an event loop that
parsed both command lines and GUI events.</p>
<p>When the GUI is loaded, the GUI looks for GUI plugins in the default
directory and in the FUTURE_TOOL_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable path.
Each file in the directory is opened and an internal entry point is
queried. If found the plugin manager calls the entry point, initializes
any exported menus, brings up the GUI, then drops into the main event
loop waiting for user interaction.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="intro_to_creating_a_panel">How do I create
the initial panel structure?</a></h2>
There's a script 'mknewpanel' in the <a class="el"
 href="Panels/html/classTemplatePanel.html">TemplatePanel</a> directory.
(.../Panels/TemplatePanel). Type in 'mknewpanel' to get a usage command.
<p>An example to create a new panel template for a panel called
"TreePanel" would be to type:</p>
<p>$ cd Panels/TemplatePanel</p>
<p>$ mknewpanel ../TreePanel TreePanel Performance "Tree Panel" 0
Performance</p>
<p>This will create a new Panels directory (TreePanel), name the new
panel "TreePanel", and a menu item "Tree Panel" will be placed under
the menu entry "Performance". It won't be shown initially (i.e. '0')
and it will be associated with the "Performance" group.</p>
